<p> The soccer world has been debating whether Messi or Ronaldo is the greatest player in soccer history </p>

<table border="1">

<tr>
	<td>Messi</td>
	<td>807</td>

<tr>
	<td>Ronaldo</td>
	<td>838</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Ronaldo has scored more goals but it doesn't mean that he is better than Messi</p>

<table border="1">

<tr>
	<th>Player</th>
	<th>Assists</th>

<tr>
	<td>Messi</td>
	<td>356</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Ronaldo</td>
	<td>237</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Though Messi has made more assists than Ronaldo, it doesn't mean Messi is better. They both should be respected.
